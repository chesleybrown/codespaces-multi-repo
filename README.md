# Multi-Repo Codespaces Example

When working with a multi-repository application, you often have a primary "bootstrap" repository that contains getting started information and local configuration files. You may also have a repository for your personal work that includes configuration files or scripts that you use to set up a your machine. In both cases, you likely then clone multiple repositories onto your local machine that use what you have set up.

GitHub Codespaces can conceptually work this same way since you can create a codespace from a bootstrap repository and then clone other repositories into the codespace. However, to improve security, Codespaces currently limits access to other repositories through a repository scoped token by default. While you can expect improvements here in time, the good news is that you can use a personal access token to work around this limitation today. This sample illustrates how to add a personal access token to a user-specific secret in GitHub, and assign it to a codespace for use instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and even automatically clone other repositories.

> **Note:** Part of the reason Codespaces defaults to repo scoped tokens is to limit the impact of your codespace being unknowingly compromised. For example, a repository you cloned could include a malicious tool that triggers on build. Using a personal access token as described here expands what a malicious process or stolen token can access, so only do this with repositories you trust, and consider minimizing privileges you give the token to only what you actually need.

## Try it

Follow these steps to try it out:

1. Fork this repository
1. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token) for use in these situations.
1. [Create a Codespaces user secret](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces#adding-a-secret) called `GH_TOKEN` with the personal access token you created in it. (To add a secret from github.com, click on your picture in upper-right > Settings > Codespaces tab > New secret button)
1. Give your forked repository access to the secrets when you create them.
1. Update `repos-to-clone.list` in your fork with any repositories you want to automatically clone using this token. You can always clone manually later if you prefer.
1. [Create a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace) from your fork.
1. After the "postCreateCommand" has finished, use **File > Open Folder...** in VS Code and go up one level (to `/workspaces`) to find the cloned repositories. 

## Optional: Multi-Root Workspace Setup
If you prefer, you can configure a multi-root workspace that you check into this bootstrap repository. This makes it easier to work with multiple repositories at the same time.

1. After following the steps above, go to **File > Add Folder to Workspace...** and select a folder.
1. After VS Code reloads, you'll see both the bootstrap repository and the cloned repository.
1. Save the workspace for future by going to **File > Save Workspace As...** and selecting a location under `/workspaces/codespace-multi-repo` (or whatever you named your bootstrap repository).
1. Commit and push the change to the bootstrap repository.

## How it works

The main trick is two lines in `clone-repos.sh` that removes the default credential manager and adds a different one:

```bash
sudo sed -i -E 's/helper =.*//' /etc/gitconfig
git config --global credential.helper '!f() { sleep 1; echo "username=${GITHUB_USER}"; echo "password=${GH_TOKEN}"; }; f'
```

The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file then includes a `postCreateCommand` to execute the script.

```json
{
    "postCreateCommand": "bash clone-repos.sh"
}
```

You can add this to any other `devcontainer.json` - this just uses the default Codespaces image rather than a custom one.

When the codespace is created, `postCreateCommand` executes `clone-repos.sh`. This script changes the git credential manager to use your personal access token, and automatically clone any repositories in `repos-to-clone.list` under the `/workspaces` folder in the codespace. The entire contents of `/workspaces` survives rebuild operations, and keeping the different repositories there prevents them from getting accidently committed into the bootstrap repository.
